# PicoShell
PicoShell is a lightweight, real-time command-line interface (CLI) for the Raspberry Pi Pico W 2 (RP2350 dual-core), built entirely in MicroPython. It brings a minimal UNIX-style shell to embedded hardware with support for Wi-Fi networking, filesystem interaction, script execution, telnet access, and more.
